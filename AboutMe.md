# Dallas Williams
My name is Dallas Williams and I am a junior at Northwest Missouri State University. I play football at Northwest as a corner and punter. I enjoy outdoor activities such as golf, disc golf, hammocking, hicking, swimming, and fishing. I am also a huge movie buff. My favorite movies include Good Will Hunting, The Italian Job, and A Few Good Men. I also watch a lot of anime and my favorite anime is Steins;Gate. I have three brothers name Brogan, Emmett, and Graham. I am the second oldest.
